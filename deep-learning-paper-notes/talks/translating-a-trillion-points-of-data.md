## Keynote: Atul Butte: Translating a Trillion Points of Data into Diagnostics, Therapies and New Insights in Health & Disease

Biomedical data is blowing up.
2.2M samples of gene data.

PubChem is doubling every year and outweighs every pharmaceutical’s dataset combined.

Precision medicine. Some measurements will be biological, some will be physical (activity levels etc), will be behavioral (you don’t like this effect, you do like this effect).

Companies are starting up based on only this public data - and there’s sooo much room for more attention. We’ll need WAY more drugs for all the personalized medicine we’re going to want to do.

6,500 different ways to treat type 2 diabetes? We can do better.

Maps of death and disease give us a way to probabilistically predict what’ll happen to you in the next 90 days.
