Authors: Dario Amodei, Chris Olah, Jacob Steinhardt, Paul Christiano, John Schulman, Dan Mane

### Categories of the problems

1. Objective function defined wrongly: avoiding side effects, avoiding reward hacking
2. An objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently: scalable supervision
3. Undesirable behavior during the learning process: safe exploration, distributional shift
